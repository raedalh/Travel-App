Additional Notes
The app relies on free APIs to fetch weather, country data, and images. Make sure to check the API limits and restrictions if you're planning to scale or deploy the app.
The app uses local storage to save trip details, which means that the saved data will persist across page refreshes but won't sync across different devices.
